# Fingerprint-Recognition

• Fingerprint analysis of images captured from a mobile phone or camera. 

• Feature extraction using Gabor filter and SIFT. Feature matching using SIFT.

• This project is built using OpenCV.

• The project is done as a part of coursework for 'Digital Image Processing' subject, at the Federal University of Alagoas(UFAL).

• Basically, this project aims at analysing images captured with mobile phones so as to extract features from a fingerprint image, perform   some filtering to improve the image quality and finally compute a match score between two fingerprints in the quest to make fingerprint   verification secure.
